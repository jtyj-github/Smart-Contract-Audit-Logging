# Smart-Contract-Audit-Logging

### Logging my Smart Contract Auditing journey in 2025 to hold myself accountable. 
### Inspired by 0xaudron's 50 days of Crushing Audits [https://github.com/0xaudron/50-days-of-crushing-audits]

### Week 1 (29 Dec - 4 Jan):

This was the holiday season, not too much work done due to festivities with friends and family. Retrospectively logging this so might have left out some stuff

👨🏻‍💻 Consolidated my learning points and reflections for TwentyOne first flight @CodeHawks (1hr) : found 1 high, 1 medium, 1 low issue

👨🏻‍💻 Finished up last few challenges of Ethernauts, up to challenge 33, and consolidated learnings on notion (10 hrs) : https://tabby-maxilla-604.notion.site/Ethernauts-16f86e3aaa42807db8dbcaeda923b627?pvs=74 

👨🏻‍💻 Audited Alchemix @CodeHawks (spent a good 16 hours on this) : Unable to identify any issues sadly, due to gaps in understanding of underlying protocols

What did I learnt new ? 
- Yearn V3 strategy template 
- Yield Tokenization Protocols
